Line a cookie sheet with damp paper towels. Place a small pot or cake pan in your sink and run a stream of cold water into it. Tap each egg all over, gently, with a spoon. Make sure to crack the top and bottom of the egg. Under the stream of water, gently peel the pieces of shell away, taking particular care around the top and bottom of the egg. This is where the flesh is most likely to peel away with the shell. When finished with each egg, place it on the damp paper towels.
